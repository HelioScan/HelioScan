DL, 17.10.2012, 19.07-19.20: Created project and class file, set inheritance.

DL, 18.10.2012, 11.33-40: Created key methods for override.

DL, 18.10.2012, 15.16-15.50 and 
DL, 18.10.2012, 16:35-16:52 R1 and R3 fulfilled.
DL, 19.10.2012, 11:23-13.43: R1-R3 fulfilled; XSettings included.
MH, 21.10.2012, 16:20-19:16: Created the spiral method. Not yet finished
MH, 21.10.2012, 19:50-20:40: Tried the double Fermat's spiral, but need to implement better the rotation.
MH, 21.10.2012, 23:45-01:15: Double Fermat spiral works. Now only angular input has to be set and more settings
MH, 22.10.2012, 23:00-00:00: R5 fulfilled, R4 semi-fulfilled: Added SpaceVector angular input. Spirals take now settings. Still have to look into timings.
MH, 23.10.2012, 23:00-00:10: R4 fulfilled. Calculation is done taking into account the hopping and activation time. This can lead to very long trajectories and thus calculation times.
