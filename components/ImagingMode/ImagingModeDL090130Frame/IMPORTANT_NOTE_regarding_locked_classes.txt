In order to be able to edit the libraries (classes) in this project, you have to temporarily "Unlock library for editing" (via right mouse click) the Xsettings.xctl in the dependencies.
When you are done with changes to the libraries, save the whole project and choose "Apply changes to all instances" (via right mouse click) for XSettings.xctl.
Note:
- This is only necessary for changes to the libraries (i.e., deleting/adding method VIs or changing their scope or editing the classes' private data (or typedefs used in the classes' private data).
- It is NOT necessary for mere changes to method block diagrams and front panels.
