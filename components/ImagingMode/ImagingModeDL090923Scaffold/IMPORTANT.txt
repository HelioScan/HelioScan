=========== IMPORTANT ==================================================================

When you implement a ScanMode component that is a child class of this scaffold component, you have to proceed as follows:
1. Create a new project.
2. Add GenericScanMode.lvlcass to the project
3. Add ScanModeDL090923Scaffold_statechart to the project.
4. Add ScanModeDL090923Scaffold.lvclass to the project.
5. Create the new class for your own component.

If you do not act exactly to this procedure, you might end up in problems with a broken statechart!!!!
